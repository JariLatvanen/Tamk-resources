# Tamk-resources
TAMK open data resources reservations

Web app to search for resource reservations at TAMK.
Written for the Front-end mestari course by Jari Latvanen.

You can search by buildig or room. Some free-text search also available.

It may be quite simple but is fast, user friendly and works on mobile as well.

The API key has been removed from the code and needs to be added.
